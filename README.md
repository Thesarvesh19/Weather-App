 Weather Web App Project Description

This is a dynamic and responsive web application that provides real-time weather and local time for any city in the world. The project's primary goal was to create a functional and visually appealing user experience.

‚ú® Key Features

- üå§Ô∏è Real-time Weather Data: The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current temperature, weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), and temperature highs and lows for the city entered by the user.
- ‚è∞ Accurate Local Time: To solve the common issue of incorrect time zones, the application uses the city's timezone offset from the API to calculate and display the precise local date and time in real time.
- üé® Dynamic and Unique Design: The user interface is built with a modern glassmorphism aesthetic. The background image, a personal touch from you, changes dynamically based on the current weather condition and the time of day (day or night).
- üé¨ Animated Visuals: To make the experience more engaging, the weather icons (sun, moon, clouds, rain, etc.) are animated with CSS to simulate realistic movements like glowing, drifting, and falling.

 üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- HTML: Provides the basic structure and layout of the web page, including the search bar, display areas for weather information, and the footer.
- CSS: Handles all the styling, including the glassmorphism effect, responsive design, animations, and the dynamic background images.
- JavaScript: The core logic of the app is handled by JavaScript, which fetches data from the API, processes it, calculates the local time, and dynamically updates the HTML and CSS to reflect the current conditions.
